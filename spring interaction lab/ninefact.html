    <big><code>Since childhood, I've had a profound affection for collecting a particular type of plush toy (to be precise, teddy bearsðŸ§¸). </code></big>
    <h3>A peculiar characteristic sets them apart â€“ their bottoms are filled with a sand-like material, giving them a reassuringly weighty feel. 
<br>
<br>
        This quirky habit originated when my aunt gifted me a teddy bear at a very young age. It was adorable, and its bottom was filled with a sand-like substance. I started cuddling it at night, a routine that has persisted into my present. In my early years, leaving it behind would trigger bouts of insomnia.

        One memorable incident was during a trip when I accidentally left it in the hotel. Upon returning home, I cried for quite some time. Fortunately, the hotel staff found my teddy bear and shipped it to me. This incident of losing and regaining it only deepened my attachment. Even though I have acquired new plush toys over the years, that teddy bear remains my most cherished and dependable companion.</h3>
