        I am a patient, and only animals can bring me healing. 
        <br>Dogs are the most adorable creatures in the world, hands down. 
        <br>The thing I look forward to the most every day is coming home, 
        <br>hugging my little dog tightly, taking a deep breath, 
        <br>and rubbing my face in his fur.
