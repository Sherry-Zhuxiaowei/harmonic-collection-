        I enjoy doing crafts. Engaging in crafting allows me to immerse myself in the process, and the sense of accomplishment upon completion captivates me. I have tried various crafts, including:
        <ol>
            <li>Paper cutting</li>
            <li>Stone plastic clay</li>
            <li>Shrink film (I've crafted many beautiful butterfly rings and earrings using shrink film)</li>
            <li>Embroidery</li>
        </ol>
        Next, I'd like to explore:
        <ul>
            <li>Pottery</li>
            <li>Glass art</li>
        </ul>
