        <li><h3> I'm that artist who loves to dive headfirst into the sea of creativity, always ready to explore <mark>different design styles</mark> and <mark>materials</mark>. From eye-catching installations to trendy clothing, bold posters, captivating books, and lively animations I've tried my hand at them all. There's a certain thrill in experimenting with various mediums, and for me, each project is a new adventure. </li></h3>
        <li><h3>Being a <mark>Communication Design major</mark>, I find joy in visually communicating ideas that resonate. Whether it's through thought-provoking installations or animations that tell a story, I aim to create work that not only catches the eye but also sparks a conversation. </li></h3></ul>
