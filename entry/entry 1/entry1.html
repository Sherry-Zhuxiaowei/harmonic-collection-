        <h3>The Cage</h3>
        <p>
            In the cage of societal norms, she dwells,
        </p>
        <p>
            A spirit once wild, now confined by their spells.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her dreams, like captive birds, no longer soar,
        </p>
        <p>
            As expectations and traditions she must explore.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            They told her to be meek, to softly speak,
        </p>
        <p>
            To follow their rules, to be mild and weak.
        </p>
        <p>
            But beneath that mask, her fire burns bright,
        </p>
        <p>
            A warrior's spirit, a fierce, untamed light.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            She'll break those bars, shatter that cage,
        </p>
        <p>
            Reclaim her essence, her passion, her rage.
        </p>
        <p>
            For she's not a puppet, nor a porcelain doll,
        </p>
        <p>
            She's a force of nature, breaking free from it all.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In the world's harsh spotlight, she'll proudly stand,
        </p>
        <p>
                   A testament to strength, a force to withstand.
        </p>
        <p>
            No longer tamed, no longer confined,
        </p>
        <p>
            She's the fierce, untamed spirit of
