        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These masks were created for my partner during a studio class, with the aim of helping her overcome fears or difficulties.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My partner is a particularly cool Japanese girl. My first impression of her was very cool, both in terms of her clothing (black attire) and appearance (cold expression and guarded eyes). However, when I interacted with her and chatted together, I discovered that she is really sweet!
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She mentioned that she often presents different versions of herself to different people, losing her true self in the process (something I can relate to as well, being familiar with people-pleasing tendencies). Therefore, I created three masks to help her rediscover herself.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first mask, the Japanese wolf, represents her tendency to protect herself and become closed off when facing strangers (the impression I initially had of her). I used a gothic style and metallic elements to convey an icy and distant feeling.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second mask, the sheep, symbolizes her excessive concern for others' opinions when dealing with friends and family, gradually neglecting her own thoughts. I incorporated many traditional Japanese elements into the mask (as her family is quite traditional), including elements from traditional Japanese masks and snacks.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third mask, the moon, represents her true self. Since she loves mint green, I made it the primary color for this mask. I painted lilies on the mask, symbolizing rebirth.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I added zippers to the first and second masks, symbolizing the layers being peeled back to reveal her true self.
