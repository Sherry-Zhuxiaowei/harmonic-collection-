            <p class="explain">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello there! I'm Zhu Xiaowei, born in the picturesque province of Shandong, China. Currently, you can find me navigating the bustling streets of New York City, where I'm passionately pursuing a degree in Communication Design at Parsons School of Design.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm that artist who loves to dive headfirst into the sea of creativity, always ready to explore different design styles and materials. From eye-catching installations to trendy clothing, bold posters, captivating books, and lively animations I've tried my hand at them all. There's a certain thrill in experimenting with various mediums, and for me, each project is a new adventure.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a Communication Design major, I find joy in visually communicating ideas that resonate. Whether it's through thought-provoking installations or animations that tell a story, I aim to create work that not only catches the eye but also sparks a conversation.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ever-inspiring cityscape of New York, I draw inspiration from the diversity that surrounds me, and it reflects in my eclectic portfolio. My creations are a fusion of cultures, ideas, and a touch of the unexpected.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not absorbed in the world of design, you might find me exploring local cafes for a dose of inspiration or seeking out the latest art exhibitions for a fresh perspective.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join me on this creative journey as I continue to blend styles, break boundaries, and bring a bit of the unexpected to the world of Communication Design. Let's connect, collaborate, and create something extraordinary together!</p>
