                    <h2>Anxiety</h2>
                    <p class="explain">On the one theme of Anxiety, I use many curves that express fluidity so that they intertwine. And I painted eyes, thorns, and circles like swirls, enabling me to show that my feelings about the theme of Anxiety are fear and confusion. For the background, I drew a lot of fragments to show that plenty of messy things surround me and make me feel anxious. I used art and design elements and principles such as repetition, pattern, asymmetrical balance, and variety in this theme. After that, I used low key and low contrast, helping me to reflect on my negative emotions.</p>

                    <h2>Agony</h2>
                    <p class="explain">it was a transitional stage from Anxiety to Expectation. This stage was painful and difficult for me to hold on to, but I would expect a clear and definite goal for the future. This expectation was like a point, a point where all my messy things were fading away, and a point that I long to touch. And in the lower left corner extending to the upper right corner, I drew several twisted shapes that hovered above like maggots, which eventually disappeared next to the sector. This process represented my anxiety fading away. At the same time, I drew different shapes in the curves, like flowing shapes, dense dots, and oddly shaped lines, showing my suffering and fear.</p>

                    <h2>Expectation</h2>
                    <p class="explain">About the theme of Expectation, I drew a sun-like symbol in the center, because Expectation is more like finding a clear direction for me so that I am not confused anymore. I also added a lot of traditional Chinese cloud patterns to emphasize that the dark clouds that were carrying my confusion had been lifted. Also, I added two small fish swimming to the center of the painting to give me a clearer sense of arrows. I used radical balance, movement, and repetition in art and design elements and principles. Then, I used high key and high contrast to show a strong sense of contrast, and the feeling of no longer being confused.</p>
