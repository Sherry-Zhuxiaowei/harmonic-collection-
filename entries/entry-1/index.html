            <p class="explain">&nbsp;&nbsp;I use my hair as a medium, the curly locks representing each of my independent thoughts and different personalities, which contrast sharply with the traditional notion of straight hair. However, the environment and the people around me use their words, laden with feudal constraints, to attack and domesticate me, molding me into what they want. Their words are like enchanted seals, cursing and sealing away the independent me.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;For thousands of years, history has attempted to domesticate women, using normative teachings to confine them. They only tell women to be good daughters, good wives, good mothers but do not allow women to have their own will. It is as if they treat women who should be pursuing equal freedom and rights as cursed with seals. They use sharp words and actions time and again against women who should be radiating their unique brilliance</p>
