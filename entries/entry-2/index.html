        <p>I chose fantasy, bathroom, and horror for my contexts. Since my monsters are the main characterâ€™s fantasies, fantasy fits well with my poster theme. My idea was to make some vague effects on the characters to show the feeling of fantasy, and to give people a sense of insanity. Later, because the protagonist was often bullied in the bathroom of the school, the location of the toilet symbolized the location of my story and the side reflected the theme of my story. At the same time, the toilet is usually a representation of darkness, dampness, and fear, so it fits the background and theme of my novel. At the same time, because my monster is another negative personality of the main character, it has a creepy tinge to it. So I think horror fits well with the theme of my novel.</p>
