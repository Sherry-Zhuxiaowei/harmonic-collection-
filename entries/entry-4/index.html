                <p>About the "<span class="change">chaste women</span>" who, in anger, hit the stone wall.</p> 
                <p>In times of famine, <span class="change">women were sold</span>,</p>
                <p>And in prosperous times, they were bound by the concepts of "<span class="change">three obediences and four virtues</span>."</p> 
                <p>The vibrant red wedding attire becomes <span class="change">a shackle</span>, </p>
                <p>The three-inch golden lotus feet are <span class="change">oppression</span>. </p>
                <p>Their rouge is like blood,</p> 
                <p>And they face the danger of encountering wolves at any moment.</p> 
                <p>Write about <span class="change">child brides</span>, </p>
                <p>About daughters <span class="change">forbidden from attending school</span>,</p> 
                <p>About being confined within <span class="change">grand mansions</span> where they cannot step out of the front door.</p>

                <p>About <span class="change">constantly lowering their heads and being submissive</span>. Washing clothes, and cooking meals,</p> 
                <p>They were <span class="change">slaves and maids</span>.</p> 
                <p>"<span class="change">She cries, she resists, she feels utterly helpless</span>."</p>

                <p>“<span class="change">Matchmaking</span>,”</p>

                <p>Where neither the family nor the in-laws show any kindness.</p> 
                <p>Write about resumes discarded into trash bins,</p> 
                <p>About interviewers ruthlessly probing without boundaries.</p> 
                <p>Rumors and gossip all single her out,</p>
